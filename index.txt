3.2 Git Branching - Basic Branching and Merging
Basic Branching and Merging

Let’s go through a simple example of branching and merging with a workflow that you might use in the real world. You’ll follow these steps:

    Do work on a web site.
    Create a branch for a new story you’re working on.
    Do some work in that branch.

At this stage, you’ll receive a call that another issue is critical and you need a hotfix. You’ll do the following:

    Revert back to your production branch.
    Create a branch to add the hotfix.
    After it’s tested, merge the hotfix branch, and push to production.
    Switch back to your original story and continue working.
